A simple demonstration of nodejs using Express to get a server/client up and running.

On connection to the server the client displays a form to input a username. Once submitted the username is written to the console on the server.

This could be forked as the start of a new node.js project saving minutes of straight-forward work. Perhaps mostly useful for anyone completely new to node.js.
